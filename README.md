# Description


A simple photodetector design for relatively low bandwidth detection of optical signals.  The operator supplies anywhere between +/-5 V to +/-18 V to the three-pin male header, and these input voltages are filtered by a few 22 uK capacitors.  The positive voltage is used for reverse biasing the photodiode, and both polarities are used for powering the dual op-amp.  The photocurrent from the photodiode passes through a transimpedance amplifier with a bandwidth of about 4 MHz which produces 1 V for 1 mW of light at 780 nm.  A second stage of amplification has adjustable gain.  The output voltage is accessible via an SMA connector.

The PCB is designed so that it can be attached to a standard Thorlabs 1/2" optical post by the central mounting hole.
